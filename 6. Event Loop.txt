Event Loop:
-----------

The Problem:
------------
* Most of the backends behind websites donâ€™t need to do complicated computations. 
* Our programs mostly do I/O operations.
* IO operations can be orders of magnitude slower than data processing. 


Task queue:
------------

* Javascript is a single-threaded, event-driven language. 
* This means that we can attach listeners to events, and when a said event fires, the listener executes the callback we provided.
