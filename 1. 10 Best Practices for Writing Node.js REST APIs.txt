Best Practices for Writing REST API's:
====================================


    * Use HTTP Methods and API Routes:
    ---------------------------------
        * Creating a REST API for creating,updating,retrieving and deleting users.
        * For these we use HTTP Verbs such as

            POST
            PUT
            GET
            PATCH/DELETE
        
        * API Routes should always use nouns as resource identifiers.
        * Speaking of the user's resources, the routing can look like this.

            POST    =>  /user or /user/:id
            GET     => /user to retrieve a list of users
            GET     => /user/:id to retrieve a user
            PATCH   => /user/:id to modifiy an existing record
            DELETE  => /user/:id to remove a user
